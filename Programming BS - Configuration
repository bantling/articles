1. Use every possible form of configuration: SQl, LDAP, files (properties/yaml/xml, etc), environment variables,

2. Never prefix configuration properties, use generic English terms that show up in thousands of unrelated places.

3. Never remove unused configuration.

4. Never document anything.

- Seperate silos for each data type (eg, Customer Address and Warehouse Address
