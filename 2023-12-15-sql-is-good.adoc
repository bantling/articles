= SQL has always been a good solution

I recently read an article at https://www.infoworld.com/article/3711272/9-reasons-sql-has-got-to-go.html suggesting
that SQL has "got to go". This article is misguided, and the claims are patently false. I'll discuss the points the
original author made, and why I believe they are off the mark.

== Tables do scale

I live in Canada. The Bank of Canada estimates there are approximately 30 million financial transactions per day in
this country. We have what we call the "Big 5" banks. If we assume they get the brunt of these transactions (lets say
two thirds), that would be 20 million transactions. If we assume an even distribution, that means they each handle
about 4 million transactions per day. Banks have been handling this kind of load every day for years, and use SQL.

Banks have obviously figured out how to scale SQL usage. I've never worked at a bank, so I do not know what they do to
scale it. I suspect part of the solution is partitioning, most likely by date range - using separate disk space for
transactions within a given date range, like a calendar month.

If a bank averages 4 million transactions per day, at worst, a partition would contain 31 days * 4 million transactions
= 124 million rows. Separate records would often be required for withdrawing from one account and depositing to another.
Assuming two rows for every transaction yields 248 million rows per month. Your average corporate craptop, which
performs far worse than an actual server, can easily find a random row out of a million in 2 ms by primary key.

I'm sure it's not that simple, and there is probably more data than that - banks have a fantastically reliable system,
and my guess is this reliability comes at the cost of more data. Even if we double that amount again, at about 500
million rows per month, that is a manageable amount of data. If that amount of data is too slow, partitions could be
more granular, like the first and second halves of the month, to cut the number of rows per partition roughly in half.

Banks in Canada are required to store data for 7 years, so the process might work something like this:

* Near the end of each month, run a job that does two things:
** Create new partition(s) for the upcoming month's date range. The partition(s) must exist before the new month, to
   ensure there are separate partition(s) to store the next month's data before the first transaction of the next
   month occurs.
** Delete any partitions more than 7 years old. This saves space for data that is not required to be stored.
** As transactions occur in the next month, they are all stored in the new partition(s) automatically.

== Nothing is "bolted on"

The author keeps referring to features as "bolted on". To borrow an English expression - "bollocks". SQL vendors aren't
stupid, they keep up with the times. Just like banks came up with email transfers to make our lives easier, SQL vendors
have added requested features like XML, JSON, window functions, partitioning, etc.

Each of these features are well thought out, which is why the are so reliable. Take JSON for example: while different
vendors implement JSON differently, they have common threads:

* A single type named JSON can internally represent an Object, Array, String, Number, Boolean, or Null value
* Operators to access particular object keys or array elements
* Functions to turn a JSON array into rows of JSON value elements, and vice-versa
* Functions to turn a JSON object into rows of string keys and JSON values, and vice-versa
*Â Operators/functions to dig through a JSON value with a path expression
* A function to determine which of the six valid types of JSON values a particular JSON value contains
* Indexes can be made on individual JSON properties, or maybe on all properties

With really not that many lines of SQL, you can do things like the following:

* Turn an object into rows of key and value columns
* Use a where clause to eliminate any keys that match some pattern that represents internal storage details that should
  not be exposed to the application.
* Rebuild a new object from the remaining rows

In the above process, the important part is that the table of keys and values has the value column typed as JSON: an sql
table must have a single type for each column, yet the values of JSON keys can be any of the six different valid JSON
values. This is why the single type JSON can internally store any of the six value types, unlike how the application
layer handles JSON.

Effectively, SQL support for JSON is fairly consistent with SQL philosophy and patterns. There is good documentation
explaining it, it doesn't require being a genius to use it. There are plenty of examples to follow on common sites like
SO, and god forbid, the vendor documentation pages.

Every new feature SQL vendors offer has the same painstaking care taken to implement it in a way that makes sense, and
to consider what kind of operators, functions, aggregate functions, window functions, etc might be needed for the
feature. And of course, due to user requests, sometimes additional use cases are considered, and additional operators
and so on are added over time.

Nothing is just thrown in as an afterthought. Ever.

== Marshaling is hard

No it isn't. Any language with reflection and SQL support is bound to have one or more ready made ORM solutions to
translate a row into an Object/Struct/whatever the language calls it, and vice-versa. Some solutions like Java JPA are
incredibly complex, but in my view that is a more a symptom of the Java community making mountains out of mole hills for
practically everything.

Generally speaking, languages have low level database support like the following, that these ORMs are built on:

* Open a connection
* Create a statement with a parameterized query
* Set the parameter values
* Execute the query in one of two ways:
* For write queries, did it succeed or fail
* For read queries, collect the results into one or more objects added to some kind of list/array/whatever it is called

Like anything, if the ORMs you see are way too complicated, you can make a simple one. All you really need at a minimum,
is to figure out the reflection details of translating SQL types into application types and vice-versa. This isn't as
bad as it sounds, as most SQL driver implementations allow some flexibility, such as you can ask for any type as
a string.

You can also write a code generator that takes some kind of specification - I would use TOML if I did this today - and
generate Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) that represent the columns of a table, and Data Access Objects (DAOs) that have
methods for operations like the following:

* Upsert one DTO
* Upsert many DTOs
* Select one row by id
* Select many rows by ids
* Delete one row by id
* Delete many rows by ids
* Helper methods
** Populate a statement from a DTO and vice-versa
** Collect query results into one DTO or a list of DTOs

Any custom queries can be written as methods of subclasses of the generated DAOs in a different directory, so that when
the code generator is rerun later, it can begin by wiping the directory of generated classes to ensure that:

* any no longer relevant previously generated classes are removed
* custom subclasses are untouched

Arguably, making your own solution sounds like time wasted, but if you have a situation that warrants it, why not?
EG, in Java, there are less popular, simpler solutions than JPA available, exactly because, like me, they figure JPA is
an overblown memory hog.

== SQL is not good at real time

In this case, the author has a point - but that does not mean SQL should be abandoned. Just because you can dream up a
case SQL is not good at, does not mean throwing it out entirely. Instead, it means adding another solution based on the
data in the SQL database.

I haven't used real time databases, but I'm sure there are ways to populate real time databases from SQL data as SQL
data is added, with some kind of replication. The SQL database might even have such replication built in, or could be
added - eg, Postgres has Foreign Data Wrappers that might help in this case.

You don't have to have one database to rule them all. Usually, you can do everything you need with SQL, but not always -
just like everything else.

== JOINs are hard

No they aren't. You only really have to understand a few keys ideas to pick them apart:

* All joins of table a to table b effectively collect all columns of table a and table b into one flat list of columns
* Just using a comma means a cartesian cross product - multiply every row of table a by every row of table b. This is
  most often used when the data selected from table a and/or b is a single row, so that you are only multiplying by one.
* A left join of table a to table b is optional - the corresponding row in b may not exist, in which case all columns of
  b are null for that specific row. This can be detected by checking if the primary key column of b is null.
* A right join of table a to table b requires a corresponding row in b to exist, otherwise the row in a is filtered out.
  It effectively acts as a where criteria, and could be rewritten as a left join where the primary key of b is not null.
* A full join of table a to table b provides three kinds of rows:
** A row exists in both table a and table b and all columns have data
** A row exists in table a only, all table b columns are null
** A row exists in table b only, all table a columns are null

== Columns are not a waste of space

Since you can have columns that are type JSON, you can use JSON to store fields for various counter-cases of the usual
SQL table definition, such as:

* Rarely used fields that will only exist for a very small percentage of rows
* User defined fields
* Fields whose type can vary depending on other values of some of the non-JSON columns and/or JSON properties

You don't have to use only non-JSON or only JSON columns. You can mix and match for perfectly good reasons.

== Optimizers don't always help

This is not quite true. Yes, some queries may not scale super well, but that is where proper application design comes
into play. You should design the application to have a separate model, where only the model code knows you are using
SQL, and contains all SQL queries.

If a given query doesn't scale somehow, then the model can do anything necessary to speed up that query, such as:

* Use the EXPLAIN command to finds out why the query is slow, and take actions, such as:
** Add another index
** Start using partitions
** Add materialized views - views backed by a table to store the results in, where you have to periodically refresh
   the view
* Write more efficient model code that could, for example, use multiple queries of less data per query and give the
  optimizer a better choice of indexes to use for them.
* Cache data with Redis

I know some people will say "but we're using microservices and they each own their own tables".

* Having each service own its own tables is not very good for various reasons, such as:
** If a feature like row level authorization is required, you have to implement it in every service
** If some tables need extra solutions like caching, it is hard to know which tables use these extra solutions
* A better idea is to have one microservice whose sole responsiblity is to do all querying
** It acts as a choking point, a single place to implement features like row level authorizations
** It is a form of the Single Responsibility principle, where one service is just data, and each other service is just
handling the details like validations of one data type
* Just because it is popular to have each service own its own table does not make it a good idea

== Denormalization is generally not needed

I'm sure there are use cases for it, but I have personally never needed it for any project I've worked on. You don't
have to choose normalized or denormalized - you can have a hybrid of both, where a view can be used to produce a
denormalized view of multiple normalized tables.

Such a view can be materialized to act as a cache to speed up results, and has the added benefit of not having to keep
replicating the same join conditions in multiple queries. This is why purists suggest always using views - it allows
for manipulating views in any way needed over time, without always having to tweak application code.

Your SQL vendor may support "INSTEAD OF" triggers, which apply only to views. Such a trigger can be added to the
denormalized view to translate the denormalized data into the normalized tables.

== Somebody has to actually learn SQL

The original article reads like someone who is not interested in learning SQL in any real depth. I keep encountering
this throughout my career, but much more so in more recent years. It seems to me that the following events have occurred
over the course of the last 15 years:

* Software companies had DBAs when I started, who helped devs with advice on improving performance, and how to make
certain kinds of queries
* Companies stopped hiring DBAs, leaving a gap of nobody who really knows databases in depth
* Companies started using the cloud, where most of the management of a database is offloaded to the cloud company
* ORMs like JPA that have a lot of complexity cropped up, and became defacto standard tools
* Developers got used to not having to write SQL

As a result of this progression, a lot of developers out there today:
* Have probably never worked with a DBA
* Are unaccustomed to writing SQL queries of any real complexity
* Do not know what features are available for speeding up queries or scaling performance
* Do not know their SQL database can do any of the following:
** Full text searching
** Graph queries
** Hierarchical queries

This knowledge gap isn't due entirely to the developers, companies need to ensure they have some database developers.
Maybe not every team needs a database developer, but companies need to have some available for those who need them.
Developers need to get in the habit of assuming that their SQL database will serve their needs until a more savvy
database developer says otherwise.

A little common sense goes a long way:
* If nobody understands how some queries work, how is that different than nobody understanding how some Java code works?
The same solution can be used to solve both these problems: appropriate comments and documentation
* If you are using several different strategies in the database, document each strategy, including what problem is
being solved, and how it is being solved with a concrete example
* CTEs are a good way of making your SQL readable in a top down fashion, more procedural like applicationÂ code
* Comment queries just like you would comment application code

I am not an old, greybeard, Gandalph DBA. I am a developer who happens to have a keen interest in databases, and am in
the process of migrating an ETL from MSSQL Server to BigQuery. There are a lot of BQ functions and procedures simply
because the original MSSQL solution was written that way, and it is the easiest way to translate the code. Others who
aren't me and weren't involved in the original implementation can understand the approaches being used, and can keep up
with the kinds of queries we're writing.
